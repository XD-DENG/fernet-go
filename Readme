Fernet allows you to easily generate and verify HMAC-based
authentication tokens for issuing API requests between remote
servers. It also encrypts data, so it can be used to transmit
secure messages over the wire.

This package is compatible with the Ruby implementation at
https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet. They can exchange tokens
freely in both directions.

See http://godoc.org/github.com/kr/fernet for documentation.
