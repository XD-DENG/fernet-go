Fernet takes a user-provided *message* (an arbitrary sequence of
bytes), a *key* (256 bits of entropy), and the current time, and
produces a *token*, which contains the message in a form that
can't be read or altered without the key.

This package is compatible with the Ruby implementation at
https://github.com/hgmnz/fernet. They can exchange tokens
freely in both directions.
